My image collection process involved researching the web for appropriate images and then downloading them to my  laptop. I then used a variety of software tools to refine them , such as Adobe InDesign , to adjust the brightness, contrast, and color balance . Additionally, I draw and used Adobe Illustrate to create my images that might be more suitable for my project. I used various criteria to select the images , such as the angle of the short , the resolution of the image, the clarity of the image, as well as overall composition. After selecting  the final images , I used additional software to ensure they were optimally sized and formatted for the project.
